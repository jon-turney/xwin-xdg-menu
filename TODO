Audit for resource leaks
Handle -display argument
Can we do something with /proc/pid/fd/1 to view logfile?
Mode to popup menu once and then exit?
Startup performance
Implement Path and Terminal .desktop entry keys (assuming we can find .desktop which uses it)
Implement Type=Link .desktop entry
Implement (or use gmenu implementation of) dbus activation
Remember settings such as icon size (in dotfile?)
Should catch SIGINT etc. and remove icon, rather than leaving it to taskbar to remove when it notices we've gone
